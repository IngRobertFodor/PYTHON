As a senior test automation QA specialist, I have been expanding my skill set by learning OOP with Python through various training projects on my GitHub. These projects showcase my journey in exploring different concepts and techniquesâ€”from basic scripts to more complex automation frameworks, including web automation using Selenium and pytest. As part of my ongoing professional development, I have also begun exploring how AI-driven solutions can enhance software testing efficiency and accuracy. My GitHub repositories reflect my dedication to mastering Python and applying it to the field of quality assurance.
